I am a cognitive neuroscientist working with [Sam Ling](<https://sites.bu.edu/vision/>) at Boston University. 

I use a variety of tools including EEG, functional MRI, eye tracking, and computational modelling. 

I completed my PhD at University of Chicago in 2019, where I worked with [Ed Awh and Ed Vogel](<https://awhvogellab.com/>).

Prior to my PhD work, I studied at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where I studied Mathematics and Psychology and worked with [Gina Grimshaw](<https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/>).
