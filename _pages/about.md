I am a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University, where I work with [Sam Ling](<https://sites.bu.edu/vision/>). My research explores the neural mechanisms that support visual attention and working memory. I use a range of neuroscience methods including EEG, fMRI, eye tracking, and computational modelling. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Chicago (mid-2019) with [Ed Awh and Ed Vogel](<https://awhvogellab.com/>). Prior to my PhD work, I studied Mathematics and Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where I worked with [Gina Grimshaw](<https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/>).
