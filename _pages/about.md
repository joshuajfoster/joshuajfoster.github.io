I study the neural mechanisms that support visual attention and working memory using a range of methods including EEG, fMRI, eye tracking, and computational modelling. 

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston University, where I work with [Sam Ling](https://sites.bu.edu/vision/). I completed my PhD at the University of Chicago with [Ed Awh and Ed Vogel](<https://awhvogellab.com/>). Before that, I studied Mathematics and Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where I worked with [Gina Grimshaw](<https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/>).
