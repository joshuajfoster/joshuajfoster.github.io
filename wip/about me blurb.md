Our ability to process visual input is limited, so we must prioritize relavant information for processing

Working memory is a mental workspace that allows us to hold a small number of representations "in mind". 

Our ability to process what visual input at any given moment is limited, so we must select

attention and working memory play a central role in this effort. Attention serves to

I study how how we select and remeber relevant information in our environment. 

Attention plays a key role in improving processing of relevant information at the cost of less relevant information.

I use a range of methods including psychophysics, computational modeling, electroencephalograpy (EEG) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and eye tracking.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston University, where I work with [Sam Ling](<https://sites.bu.edu/vision/>).
