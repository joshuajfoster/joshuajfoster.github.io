I study how how we select and remeber relevant information in our environment. 

Attention plays a key role in improving processing of relevant information at the cost of less relevant information.

I use a range of methods including psychophysics, computational modeling, electroencephalograpy (EEG) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University, where I work with [Sam Ling](<https://sites.bu.edu/vision/>). I completed my PhD at the University of Chicago with [Ed Awh and Ed Vogel](<https://awhvogellab.com/>). Prior to my PhD work, I studied Mathematics and Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, where I worked with [Gina Grimshaw](<https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/>).
